# Brutalism

Raw. Unpolished. Honest.

## What Is Brutalist Design?

Brutalism in web design is a **rejection of polish**. It strips away the decorative, the smooth, the *comfortable* — and exposes the structure underneath.

> "Ordinary architecture for ordinary people." — Alison Smithson

Key principles:

- Truth to materials
- Exposed structure
- No unnecessary decoration
- Function dictates form

---

## Code Is Structure

```typescript
function render(slide: Slide): string {
  const nodes = slide.nodes.map(toHTML);
  const border = "4px solid #1a1a1a";
  return `<div style="border: ${border}">${nodes.join("")}</div>`;
}
```

Inline code looks like `border: 3px solid black` — raw and visible.

## Links and Emphasis

Visit [the source](https://example.com) — underlines are **honest** indicators.

This text is *intentionally plain*. No hover animations. No color transitions. Just **weight** and **structure**.

| Material | Property |
|---|---|
| Concrete | Compression |
| Steel | Tension |
| Glass | Transparency |

## That's It

No closing animation. No fade. Just a hard stop.
